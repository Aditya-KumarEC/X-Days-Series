# 🔰 Verilog HDL – X-Days Series by Aditya Kumar

Welcome to my *X-Days Series* on Verilog HDL, where I document my daily hands-on learning journey using the **Vivado Design Suite**.  
This is not a fixed 30/60/100-day challenge — it's a self-paced series aimed at building consistent habits and deepening my practical knowledge of digital design.

## 📌 About This Series

- Each day focuses on implementing **one Verilog project** using RTL modeling.
- Projects range from *basic logic gates* to *multi-bit arithmetic circuits* and beyond.
- Every day includes:
  - ✅ Project Overview
  - ✅ RTL Code (Verilog)
  - ✅ Testbench
  - ✅ Simulation Output (GTKWave)
  - ✅ Pros, Cons & Applications
  - ✅ Tools Used (Vivado, GTKWave)

> “Learning isn’t about speed, it’s about direction.” 🚀
